How would you design a scalable system like Twitter?
Key Design Considerations:
Load Balancing – Distribute traffic using reverse proxies (e.g., Nginx, AWS ALB).
Database Scaling
Sharding: Distribute user data across multiple databases.
Replication: Read replicas to reduce database load.
Caching – Use Redis or Memcached to cache frequently accessed tweets.
Asynchronous Processing – Use message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ) for tweet delivery.
Microservices Architecture – Separate services for user management, tweets, notifications, etc.
Content Delivery Network (CDN) – Serve media (images/videos) via CDNs like Cloudflare.
Example System Flow:
User posts a tweet → Data stored in distributed databases.
Fan-out mechanism → Tweets distributed to followers via event-driven systems.
Caching Layer → Recent tweets stored in Redis for quick retrieval.

What are eventual consistency and strong consistency in databases?
Explain the difference between ACID and BASE properties in databases.

How does the Raft consensus algorithm work?
What are Bloom filters, and how do they help in backend performance?
What is the difference between horizontal scaling and sharding?

How would you prevent SQL injection in a backend system?
Use ORM (e.g., SQLAlchemy, Hibernate) – Avoid raw SQL queries.

Least Privilege Access – Limit database permissions for application users.
Web Application Firewalls (WAF) – Detect and block SQL injection attempts.

What is a distributed cache, and how does it work?

Q72. How do you ensure data consistency in a distributed system?
Maintaining data consistency across multiple nodes is critical in distributed systems.
Techniques:
Strong Consistency (Synchronous Replication) – Writes are instantly reflected across all nodes.
Eventual Consistency (Asynchronous Replication) – Updates propagate over time.
Consensus Algorithms (Raft, Paxos) – Ensures agreement on data updates.
Quorum-based Reads/Writes – Requires a majority of nodes to acknowledge changes.
Idempotent Operations – Repeated operations produce the same result.


Q73. What is eventual consistency, and how does it affect distributed databases?
Eventual Consistency means that in a distributed system, all copies of data will become consistent over time, but not immediately.
How It Affects Databases:
Fast Reads/Writes – Prioritizes availability over immediate consistency.
Temporary Inconsistencies – Some nodes may have outdated data until they sync.
Used in AP Systems (CAP Theorem) – Prioritizes Availability & Partition Tolerance.

Explain how to handle high concurrency in backend systems.
Handling high concurrency means efficiently processing many simultaneous requests without performance degradation.
Techniques:
Connection Pooling – Reuse database connections to prevent overload.
Load Balancing – Distribute traffic across multiple servers.
Asynchronous Processing – Use message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ) to handle tasks in the background.
Optimized Database Queries – Use indexes, caching, and avoid N+1 query problems.
Rate Limiting & Throttling – Prevent API abuse and maintain stability.


 How do you debug a performance bottleneck in a large-scale system?
Performance bottlenecks slow down a system. Debugging them requires a systematic approach.
Steps to Identify & Fix Bottlenecks:
Monitor System Metrics – Use Prometheus, Grafana to analyze CPU, memory, and network usage.
Profile Code Execution – Identify slow functions with Flamegraphs, APM tools (New Relic, Datadog).
Analyze Database Performance – Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to detect slow queries.
Check for Thread Contention & Locks – Identify deadlocks in multi-threaded environments.
Optimize Resource Allocation – Increase server capacity, add caching, or improve indexing.
